* What?

=libcardiacarrest= is a trivial implementation of =libpulse*= PulseAudio library API that
unconditionally (but gracefully) fails to connect to the PulseAudio daemon and does **nothing** else.

[[https://github.com/i-rinat/apulse][apulse]] and
[[http://git.r-36.net/pressureaudio/tree/README.md][pressureaudio]] (which uses apulse internally)
are an inspiration for this but unlike those two projects =libcardiacarrest= is not an emulation
layer, all it does is it gracefully fails to provide the requested PulseAudio service hoping the
application would try something else (e.g. ALSA or JACK).

* Why?

Many apps can be built with PulseAudio support, many people want that support, many other people
(e.g. me) freak out at the single mention of linking against PulseAudio libraries (see below).

This project provides a way to produce software artifacts that work for both camps without building
two different versions of everything.

The general framework is as follows:

- You use original PulseAudio headers (bundled) but link against =libcardiacarrest= libraries at
  link time. Unlike the original =libpulse=, =libcardiacarrest= doesn't permit static linking, so
  it's impossible to f*ck it up. (You can skip this step if you don't build your software yourself
  and you are not sufficiently paranoid.)

- If you want to use PulseAudio daemon you then simply run your apps in an environment where your
  dynamic loader can find the original =libpulse= and everything works as expected.

- But if instead you point your dynamic loader to =apulse/pressureaudio= then playback will ignore
  the daemon and will go over pure ALSA (but many other features will not work).

- Finally, if you point your dynamic loader to =libcardiacarrest= then an app that uses =libpulse=
  API will get "can't connect to the daemon" error and (hopefully) will simply switch to another
  output plugin like ALSA or JACK (=mpv= does exactly this, YMMV) and not just crash.

The intended use of this is

- you point your dynamic loader to =libcardiacarrest= by default,
- you override =LD_LIBRARY_PATH= with =apulse/pressureaudio= and the original libs on app-by-app
  basis.

But you can also use it backwards by running with the original libs by default and overriding with
=libcardiacarrest= for selected apps (e.g., the browser) or whatever.

* Explanation by examples

So you linked your =mpv= with =libcardiacarrest=.

- With original =libpulse= in =LD_LIBRARY_PATH=:
  - You start =mpv=
  - it tries its =pulse= output plugin, that loads original =libpulse=
  - =libpulse= tries the daemon, starts it if it isn't up already
  - =libpulse= connects to it, sets everything up
  - =mpv= pushes decoded waves to =libpulse=
  - =libpulse= pushes them to the daemon
  - the daemon pushes them to ALSA
  - ALSA pushes them to the kernel
  - sound starts playing

- With =apulse libpulse= in =LD_LIBRARY_PATH=:
  - You start =mpv=
  - it tries its =pulse= output plugin, that loads =apulse libpulse=
  - =apulse= starts emulating the =libpulse= API over ALSA
  - =mpv= pushes decoded waves to =apulse=
  - =apulse= pushes them to ALSA
  - ALSA pushes them to the kernel
  - sound starts playing

- With =libcardiacarrest libpulse= in =LD_LIBRARY_PATH=:
  - You start =mpv=
  - it tries its =pulse= output plugin, that loads =libcardiacarrest libpulse=
  - =libcardiacarrest= pretends it tries the daemon, fails
  - =mpv= is like "hm, PulseAudio daemon is not available, let's try something else"
  - =mpv= tries another output plugin, say =alsa=
  - it sets itself up
  - =mpv= pushes decoded waves to ALSA
  - ALSA pushes them to the kernel
  - sound starts playing

The point is that =libcardiacarrest= is not an emulation layer, it just gracefully fails to provide
the requested service.

* Why not just link against the original PulseAudio libs and run no daemon then?

I don't want a single executable bit of PulseAudio on my machine.

- PulseAudio is very anti-UNIX and anti-KISS (the opposite of "small, sharp tools" and "tools, not
  restrictions").
- The code is enormous (ENORMOUS), over-engineered and of overall pretty shitty quality. It's
  impossible to tell how many zero-days it contains.
- I have yet to meet a single person who still wanted to run PulseAudio on their machine after
  reading PA sources. All people I've shown the sources to were either laughing, crying or both at
  the end of the session. Yes, that includes the library (see [[file:src/pulse.c][src/pulse.c]] for
  some notes on the subject).
- I don't like the ethics of pushing over-engineered software onto under-informed users who are
  unable to resist the tyranny of free cycles (binary packages).
- Hence, I consider any software that is deliberately PulseAudio-only to be unethical (if not
  malicious). There are equivalent libraries with similarly convenient APIs (e.g. =openal=, =libao=)
  that are similarly (actually, more) cross-platform that (transparently) provide a choice over
  audio backends. Shoving PulseAudio down everyone's throats is not a service to users.

* Well, okay, any technical arguments against it?

- See comments in [[file:src/pulse.c][src/pulse.c]].
- Xorg is a daemon, Wayland is a library. Yay, Wayland! PulseAudio is a daemon, ALSA is a library.
  Yay, PulseAudio? PulseAudio is exactly X11 for audio. The library-to-daemon protocol is similarly
  complicated, protocol parsing code is written by hand (not autogenerated, like for =xcb=), when
  exposing PulseAudio to the network all of that code gets exposed to the network, to hide that
  shitty code from the scary net they introduce yet another complicated authentication protocol on
  top of it, exactly like X11.

  Imagine exposing init system's administrative interface (e.g. systemd's =systemctl= call) to an
  untrusted network. Sounds crazy, right? PulseAudio does pretty much this. PulseAudio is an audio
  daemon, but it's also a plugin system, small init system (for its plugins) and authentication
  system at the same time. The =libpulse= library also includes its own alternatives to iconv, glib
  and a bunch of slightly-different functions from libc. This is pure crazyness (very typical of
  Lennart Poettering creations, you might have heard of =systemd=, =dbus= and =avahi=, all of that
  is him). Pushing uninformed people into running PulseAudio connected to untrusted data sources is
  unethical.

  Yep, I'm looking at you, Firefox developers, all your sandboxing means exactly nothing if the
  attacker gets to the PA socket.
- PulseAudio clients can gather all kinds of information about your hardware setup and other
  connected clients (see =pa_context= API and =pulse/introspect.h= in PA headers).
- PulseAudio clients can helpfully start/restart the daemon for you.
- PulseAudio clients can reconfigure the daemon on the fly.
- PulseAudio clients can dynamically load and unload modules into the daemon. And PulseAudio ships
  with a bunch of crazy modules by default.

Even if all the code paths in the original =libpulse= with no daemon available would have lead
straight to errors (which is not the case, it does a lot of shit even without a daemon and tries to
spawn a daemon at every corner) I would still prefer to link against =libcardiacarrest= in case I
f*ck something up in my config.

Just read the sources (and then you, too, would try to stay away from it forever).

* But an app I want doesn't run without PulseAudio!

Use [[https://github.com/i-rinat/apulse][apulse]] and/or
[[http://git.r-36.net/pressureaudio/tree/README.md][pressureaudio]].

* But I need an audio daemon!

Like with X11, most likely, you do not. ALSA does software mixing by default for a decade now (but a
lot of documentation on the net is outdated). Primary sound cards, bluetooth headsets,
per-application soft volume, +loopback (aka "desktop sound") capture+ (comes out-of-the-box with
ALSA 1.1.6) and quasi-dynamic output switching can be configured with a couple of lines of
=asound.conf=.

However, like with X11, sometimes you do need a daemon, and if you need an audio daemon you should
use [[http://www.sndio.org/][sndio]] or [[http://www.jackaudio.org/][JACK]] (I prefer =v1= as it
doesn't require =dbus=). Their library-to-daemon protocols are much simpler (sndio's is simply
trivial), library API is much cleaner (sndio's one fits on a single page), they don't lag, they
introduce no latency, and they also do MIDI, not just PCM. Unfortunately, neither of them is a
default choice in Ubuntu, so relatively few apps target them (but almost all pro-audio apps have
=JACK= support).

For uncooperative apps you can use =apulse= to go =PA->ALSA= and then =alsa-plugins= to go
=ALSA->JACK=. Works for me, YMMV.

If you have to run PulseAudio at least don't simply attach it to untrusted data sources. Including
the browser. I recommend you to run Firefox with =apulse/pressureaudio= to make it play over pure
ALSA and then use =pulse= module of =alsa-plugins= to go from ALSA back to PA. Yes, I really do
recommend doing =apulse->ALSA->PA->ALSA= instead of the normal =libpulse->PA->ALSA=. This way
Firefox gets no direct access to PulseAudio daemon.

* Implementation details

=libcardiacarrest= only implements PA =mainloop= and =context= creation, everything else either
pretends to do something but does absolutely nothing, returns errors, or simply aborts the whole
process (when it's unclear how to do something saner without writing a lot of code).

=libcardiacarrest= wants to be the minimal amount of code required to make all the (sane) apps think
that =libpulse= works, but the daemon is not available. Insane uses of the API like modifying lots
of PA-structures before ever trying to connect to the daemon will cause the process to abort, it's
by design, fix your app (or report my misunderstanding of your sanity).

In total, =libcardiacarrest= logic is implemented in ~100 LOC of fairly trivial code, everything
else is just PA cruft (yep, it's a lot).

The only dependencies are =libc= and =glib=.
